**What this is**

* a sequential raytracer for geometrical optics
* a tool with presets and user defined surface shapes, ray sources and media
* a library with an additional GUI with ray and geometry visualization
* a renderer for colored detector images inside an optical setup
* a program including paraxial analysis (matrix optics, position of cardinal points/planes and psf convolution)
* a programming/scripting approach to simulation
* free, open source software


**What this isn't**

* a GUI focussed tool
* an optics design program with optimization and tolerancing
* simulation incorporating wave optics, e.g. diffraction, interference
* a non-sequential raytracer, simulating ghost images, reflections
* a tool supporting mirror or fresnel lens optics
* mature, bug-free software


**Who/what is this for**

* educational purposes, demonstrating aberrations or simple optical setups
* introductionary tool to paraxial, geometrical optics or image formation
* simulation of simpler systems, like a prism, the eye model or a telescope
* estimation of effects where professional software (ZEMAX, Quadoa, ...) would be overkill for
