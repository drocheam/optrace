Autofocus
-----------------------


.. testsetup:: *

   import optrace as ot
   RT = ot.Raytracer(outline=[-1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 60], silent=True)
   RS = ot.RaySource(ot.Point(), pos=[0, 0, 1])
   RT.add(RS)
   RS = ot.RaySource(ot.Point(), pos=[0, 0, 1])
   RT.add(RS)
   RT.trace(1000)


Goal
____________________

Focus finding can be categorized into two different goals

1. finding a focal point
2. finding the position of an image plane in an imaging system


Focus Modes
____________________

The following focus methods are available:

* **Position Variance**: minimizes the variance of the lateral ray position
* **Airy Disc Weighting**: weights the ray positions with a spatial sensitivity of the zeroth order of an airy disc
* **Irradiance Maximum**: finds the position with the highest irradiance
* **Irradiance Variance**: finds the positions with the highest irradiance variance
* **Image Sharpness**: finds the position with the sharpest edges

More details as well as the mathematical formulations can be found in :numref:`autofocus`.


Usage
______________



To use the focus finding you will need a traced raytracer ``Å”T`` geometry with one or multiple ray sources.
The ``autofocus`` function is then called by passing the focus mode and a starting position.
Focussing then tries to find the focus in a search region between the last lens (or the outline) and the next lens (or the outline).

.. testcode::

   res, afdict = RT.autofocus("Position Variance", 12.09)

``autofocus`` returns two results, where the first one is a ``scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult`` object with information on the root finding. 
The found z-position is accessed with ``res.x``.
The second return value includes some additional information, while these are mostly only useful for the ``TraceGUI`` information or the cost plot.

By default, rays of all different sources are used to autofocus. Optionally a ``source_index`` parameter can be provided to use only a specific ray source.

.. testcode::

   res, afdict = RT.autofocus("Position Variance", 12.09, source_index=1)


With many rays the focus finding can get very slow. However, for modes ``"Position Variance", "Airy Disc Weighting"`` after some large number of rays the cost function does not change anymore. That's why it is sufficient to limit the number of rays for those cases.
You can higher or lower the number ``N`` for this with a parameter. Note that this rarely needs to be done.

Mode ``"Position Variance"`` uses a slightly different approach for root finding, which leads to some parameters missing in ``afdict``.
When plotting a cost plot, as described later, these parameters need to be calculated and included. This is done by setting ``return_cost=True``, but don't set it if not necessary, as it unfortunately slows down the focus mode.

.. testcode::

   res, afdict = RT.autofocus("Position Variance", 12.09, N=10000, return_cost=True)


Limitations
__________________


Below you can find some limitations of ``autofocus`` in ``optrace``

* search only between lenses or a lens and the outline
* the behavior of filters and apertures is ignored. If a ray exists at the start of a search region, it also exists at the end.
* the same way rays are not absorbed by the outline in the search region
* in more complex cases only a local minimum is found
* see the limitations for each method in :numref:`autofocus`. 

Application Cases
____________________

Below you can find multiple application cases an preferred autofocus methods.

**Case 1**: perfect, ideal focal point
 * **examples:** focus of an ideal lens. Small, local illumination of a real lens
 * **preferred methods:** all methods find the focus correctly, for performance reason "Position Variance" should be used

**Case 2:**  broad or no distinct focal point
 * **examples:** lens with large spherical aberration, multifocal lens
 * **preferred methods:** None, largely different behavior depending on method choice
 * **behaviour known from experience**
    * Position Variance: finds a compromise between multiple foci, often inbetween their position
    * Airy Disc Weighting: Ignores glares, halos and rays with large distance from airy disc
    * Irradiance Maximum: finds the focus with the largest irradiance
    * Image Sharpness: Not suited, since its searches for sharp structures
    * Irradiance Variance: similar behavior to Image Sharpness and Irradiance Maximum

**Case 3:** finding the image distance
 * **example:** lens setup with multiple lenses, we want to find the distance where the image has the highest sharpness
 * **preferred methods:** Image Sharpness, in some specific edge cases Irradiance Variance/Maximum might work.


.. topic:: Note

   Generally it is recommended to plot the cost function of the optimization so one can see if there are multiple minima and how distinct the found value is.
   The TraceGUI has an option for plotting the cost function.


Cost Plots
___________________________

Cost plots are especially useful to debug the focus finding and check how pronounced a focus or focus region is.
Plotting the cost function and result is done by calling the ``autofocus_cost_plot`` method from ``optrace.plots``.
It requires the ``res, afdict`` parameters from before.

.. code-block:: python

   from optrace.plots import autofocus_cost_plot

   autofocus_cost_plot(res, afdict)


Optionally one can overwrite the ``title`` and make the plot window blocking by setting ``block=True``.

.. code-block:: python

   autofocus_cost_plot(res, afdict, title="abcd", block=True)


Below you can find examples for cost plots.

.. list-table::

          Focus finding for mode "Position Variance" in the ``spherical_aberration.py`` example.

When working with the ``TraceGUI`` it also outputs focus information, like the following:

::
