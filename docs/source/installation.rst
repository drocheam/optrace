Installation
################

This library requires Python 3.10

**Instructions**

#. make sure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system
#. download/clone the whole project repository. This is the folder that includes the ``optrace``-folder as well as the ``setup.py`` file.
#. open a terminal in the downloaded folder and run ``pip install .`` <- Note that the dot is part of the command.

This automatically runs the file ``setup.py``, which provides all the required information for the installation.
After this, ``optrace`` should be installed on your system.
